Card Detection with OpenCV

This paper introduces basic concepts and features of digital image processing and devotes a majority of its content to defining and exploring the Canny Edge detection algorithm with its applications on a given dataset. There are many edge detection methods, which mainly use the changes in intensity to find the edges of an image. However, the intensity change can also be gradual where the edge detection operator then has to be modified for proper edge detection. Consequently, there are problems of lack of true edges, false edge detection, and high computational time. This is why a simple program is built by using Canny's method with other image processing modifications to find a process which correctly predicts edges and has a low computational time.
